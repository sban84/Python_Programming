n python 3, if you're using unittest.TestCase:

You must have an empty (or otherwise) __init__.py file in your test directory (must be named test/)
Your test files inside test/ match the pattern test_*.py. They can be inside a subdirectory under test/, and those subdirs can be named as anything.
Then, you can run all the tests with:

python -m unittest

// to run a specific test class
python -m unittest my_unit_test_script.py


-- pytest
